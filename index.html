    <p>KG: "So I'm transgender and I was endometriosis. I'm really lucky cos I was 18 or so when I found out which is really early compared to a lot of people. I went to see my family doctor at the time and she thought that I probably had endometriosis, but that I'd need to have surgery to be sure. The thing that really sticks out for me that she said was she referred to endometriosis as the 'Nun's disease' and said to me that the easiest solution by far would be for me to try and get pregnant. She like laughed as she was saying it but I could tell that she meant it. I was like really deeply closeted at this time, like, so so deeply closeted, barely even out to myself as gay let alone trans and it was like, really like a fucked up thing to say. So she said to me that I had two options at that time: that I could go on this particular kind of drug that would make me more hairy, that would give me pimples, and that would likely make my voice drop or that I could go on the pill. So, for the longest time since I was a like a teenager I had been bullied for being too hairy, um, and it was a really big thing. I like, shaved my legs twice a day, I really suffered um and was really shamed for it. So there was no way I was choosing that first drug. So the the pill it was, I went on the pill. And the pill kind of really fucked me up. Like, I think even 20 years later I'm still sorta recovering from the mood swings that I had at that time, over six years. First one kind then the another, then another, just over and over again trying to find one that fit. Um, and I will admit, like, the irony is not lost on me that the drugs that I refused at that time, the ones that would make me hairier and drop my voice and give me pimples, are really similar to T, testosterone, this drug that I've kind of been thinking about taking for nearly a decade now; that's pretty funny. So all of this came from kind of the same family doctor who also, later, shamed me for coming out as gay, for making my mum upset. So, an interesting relationship with our family doctor there. When I did, ah, finally come out, ironically my parents said it would have been easier if I had told them that I was pregnant. Um, I was so young at this stage, I was like 20\. The peak experiences of my life at this time are like writing love sick poems to my crush in the university library when I should have been studying and like, thinking that maybe, I could look cool in double denim and like I wore socks with Shrek on them to my first surgery for endometriosis, for courage. Like, I was very young. So after that, like I took the pill for a really bloody long time, like longer than I would ever think was really necessary. So after about like, six years, I just stopped taking it and settled for being in pain like all the time. So, my second surgery came, like, a few years later. I was walking down the street, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut, I had to sit down right where I was. I thought it was appendicitis, it turned out to be a really massive ovarian cyst. So this time when I went to the see the gyno, this doctor game a business card with this picture of a cartoon woman on it, looking back through her own legs at a picture of a cat. And I like, turned to my partner and I'm like 'This is a pussy joke from a gyno' [laughs] like, what the hell? So this doctor, she tells me straight to my face that I'm too fat and that I need to go cycling around a park to get better. She's like, explaining it to me as if I'm like a tiny child, so she's making little cycling motions with her hands as she says it. I'm 28 years old at the time. So, like, I've been out as trans for a while at this stage and I will admit being constantly 'she' pronoun-ed whilst wearing a paper gown, waiting for surgery is not the most um, ideal of circumstances in my life. My third surgery was when I was about 34\. So I was leading a really big team, ah, and I was really really busy and I was in a big city that wasn't my home town. So I was using my name at this stage at work, but not my pronouns, um, and it was a really tough gig because I was pushing really hard there for like access and inclusion and equality and it was partly because I really wanted the organisation to change and it partly self motivated because I also just really wanted to make the place somewhere where I felt like I could belong. Um, and I really tried with that and we did get somewhere but like it never really got there for me. So when I was working in that gig, I can remember taking the car every day because the walk to the tram stop was too far. I can remember, like sitting in  meetings and having people misunderstand my facial expression because I was gritting my teeth cause I was in so much pain. I can really remember like many occasions where I was like leaning on the door frame of my managers office, because I couldn't actually stand up unaided. So I was like trying to look hella cas[ual], but I was actually like really needing the support of the wall to actually stand up. I was really struggling at that time, everything was so, like non stop and intense and I was really really tired. So my gyno now, like who I go and see, is pretty friendly. She has trans flags on the counter. Recently were talking about, like should I or should I not have a hysterectomy and I find it really interesting because nobody would talk to me about this before. They said I had to keep like, all of my options open. They said you might want to carry a child some day. And like, it's really interesting because though I love kids, like, I actually haven't really ever planned to carry a child, but I could never really get that message across to medical professionals before now. But I've just turned 40, so I guess it's kind of ok for medical people to finally accept that that might be true. When I really think about myself and healthcare and endometriosis, I'm just like, can doctors actually see me? Can they see me for the being like, a heartsick teenager who thought they were too hairy for love? Can they see me when I'm like, this young person who was like, being told I should get pregnant because I had 'Nun's disease'? Can they see me when I'm like this sort of young, queer person tentatively exploring my gender? Can they see me when I'm like, managing a big team of people and also trying to manage chronic pain? Can they see me as I really am? Can they see me as I see myself? Like, I'm really lucky that there is effective, decent treatment here in Australia. But I also feel what I would really like is to be seen and to be cared for in these processes as well."</p>
